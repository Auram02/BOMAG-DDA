BUGS / CORRECTIONS: APP VERSION 1.2.0
===================================
1.) We ran into an issue while checking off counties that a few were missing (My fault). However because of the placement of "Edit Counties" button, Laurie didn't save the contract she was working on and pressed "Main List" button, added county and then started the contract over. She did this 5 times until she called me and said she ask for work around. I told her to check the counties and save the contract. Then add the new counties and then modify the contract to check the newly added counties. The work around is fine but I would prefer if possible to change the location of the "Edit Counties" button. This way as she is adding contracts if a county is not listed in the county window she can press the button, add it, save. The "Edit County List" Window should have "Close" button instead of  "Main List" button and it should go back to the window where you can check off counties. (Remove.tif and Add.tif)

2.) When you intially add a contract and you get to the last window "Contract Information" window we need to remove the "Print" and "Print Labels" button and just keep the "Main List" "Back" and "Save" buttons. However, when we view a contract we need the "Print" and "Print Labels" Button. REASON: We found that when Laurie would get to the last window on a new contract if she used the print button that the CREATION DATE would be TODAYS date. If she would save first than the screen would automatically take you back to the "Territory" window. At that point she would select the contract and view it. When she printed the CREATION DATE was correct. (Save.tif)

3.) Is it possible that when she click the "Print" button that it will print without further options. Currently you click print - than a window - the select printer - than print -than close. The output is exactly what we want (Except the 2 blank Page). So is it possible to speed the process and just use the "Default Printer", generate the report behind the scenes and just output that report? As far as the "Print Label" button we need it to always use the Label printer and just print the information I supplied to you about the 4 lines of text on the label in like Arial or something.
