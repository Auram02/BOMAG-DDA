BUGS / CORRECTIONS: APP VERSION 1.2.3
===================================
1.) T-Rep and S-Rep lists windows need scroll bars and to be sorted by name. (T-Rep_window)
2.) Splash screen still has an edge. I'm attaching (splash_trans.tif) which uses a channel or mask for transparency. Can you use this.

Report Issues:
1.) Refer to (reports_window.tif) for text corrections.

2.) Refer to (general_labels_window.tif) for corrections.

3.) Quick Product View - Report is excellent. No borders are fine. Just a few small fixes and questions.
        A.) In your formating can you BOLD the MAIN DISTRIBUTORS (Not locations)?
        B.) Put BOMAG Americas Distributors on the same line as Catagories. Currently it is on line above. Can these also be bold?


========================================
PRIMARY CONTACT 
========================================
The primary contact checkbox should only be located within the Main Distributor Information window. There can only be 1 Primary Contact check box checked. This information will be used in the Contract Renewal Report. (Primary_Contract.tif)
